# Linktree

A simple webpage template for setting up your own Linktree. Great if you want to dip your toes into the world of web development.

## Requirements

- GitHub account

- Git configured on your local machine

## Get Started

The easiest (and cheapest) way to get a domain name is to use GitHub Pages. Create a new public repository named *username*.github.io, where *username* is your username on GitHub. Clone the repository on your computer (SSH tends to work better than HTTPS). Navigate to the cloned repo and create a new file called index.html. Paste the following HTML code into that file:

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
</html>`

Add, commit, and push your changes:

`git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git push -u origin main`

To verify that your website is up, go to **https://*username*.github.io**

There are other ways to set up a working domain name and to customize it, but this is the simplest way to do so.
